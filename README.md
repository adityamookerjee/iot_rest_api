# iot_rest_api : Flask-based Internet of Things REST API

## Overview
This is a simple JSON rest api used to interact with a Postgres DB for an IoT device.

## Motivation
Several personal projecs of mine have involved home automation and data collection.
Simple things such as :
* Temperature and environmental sensors
I studied a lot of implementations of Python RESTful services and figured I'd like to contribue towards an open source project with some useful information for others to use
